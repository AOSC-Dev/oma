# FIXME: liblzma-rs requires xz/liblzma >= 5.8 for dynamic linking, or it
# would fallback to static linking.
#
# However, with Ubuntu 22.04, oma built with statically linked
# xz/liblzma >= 5.6 would cause data errors during decompression (when
# xz(1) is called) - there seems to be some strange ABI incompatibilities
# between liblzma 5.2 and liblzma >= 5.6.
# 
# Hold async-compression at 0.4.19 for now (which uses xz2 that allows
# dynamic linking with older xz/liblzma versions).
